## Custom Search 

Welcome to our innovative Custom Search App  ðŸš€

Our app combines the power of Google's Custom Search API and the ScrapingBee API to provide you with a seamless and comprehensive search experience.

How does it work?

1. Enter your query: Simply type in your search query in the input field.
2. Click "Search and Scrape": Hit the button, and our app will use the Google Custom Search API to fetch the top 5 web page URLs related to your query.
3. Scrape the URLs: Next, our app leverages ScrapingBee API's web scraping capabilities to extract the text content from those 5 URLs. It efficiently handles the complexities of web scraping, so you get the information you need hassle-free.
4. Display the results: The extracted text from all 5 URLs will be neatly displayed in separate paragraphs, right on your screen!
